# TYPO3 extension `page_backend_layout`

This extension provides the basic configuration for typed categories.
It is not recommended to use this extension alone, as it only provides a basic
framework. In order to perform typification, an addition in a separate extension
is required.

## Installation

Install with your flavour:

* [TER](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/page_backend_layout/)
* Extension Manager
* composer

We prefer composer installation:
```bash
composer req fgtclb/page-backend-layout
```
